# Random Cocktail Generator

## Project Description

With people not being able to go out to their favorite restaurants/bars for custom cocktails, this application is meant to inspire users with new cocktail recipes that they normally wouldn't make at home. With a click of a button, random cocktail recipes will be generated with ingridients and instructions needed to mix a cocktail at home!

## Wireframes

[https://wireframe.cc/SPpcwD]


#### MVP 

- Access an external api 
- Render random data on page every time a event listener is activated
- Structure information within flexbox
- Infuse at least one animation

#### PostMVP  

- Add a second API that has the option to look up a specific cocktail if the user already has one in mind.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Sept 18-21| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|Sept 21| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Sept 22| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Sept 23| MVP | Incomplete
|Sept 24| Post MVP/Styling | Incomplete
|Sept 25| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
