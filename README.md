# Random Cocktail Generator

https://allicue.github.io/random-cocktail-generator/

## Project Description

This application is meant to inspire users with new cocktail recipes, accessed from a REST API, that they normally wouldn't make at home- especially those tired of drinking the same beer or wine during virtual happy hours. With a click of a button, random cocktail recipes will be generated with ingredients and instructions needed to mix a handcrafted cocktail in the comfort of the user's home. Users can also search for a recipe if they have one in mind.

- Add in a feature that generates cocktail recipies based off what spirits the user has in their bar.
